## 📌 PROJECT CONTEXT (YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THIS PERFECTLY)

This project is a **Telegram Bot written in Python** that helps users (students & ML engineers) **find and download Machine Learning datasets directly from Telegram**.

### Core Behavior:
- The bot listens for user messages
- A **predefined keyword** (example: `MLParest`) triggers:
  - Direct download links for:
    - Training dataset
    - Testing dataset
    - README file
    - Research paper (PDF)
- These files are **securely hosted on cloud storage or a VPS**
- Users can download files without leaving Telegram

### Dynamic Search Feature:
If a user sends **any other keyword or project description**:
- The bot automatically searches:
  - HuggingFace Datasets
  - Kaggle Datasets
  - GitHub repositories
- Uses:
  - Kaggle API
  - HuggingFace Hub API
  - GitHub search (API or scraping)
- Returns **clean, well-formatted dataset links inside Telegram**

### Technical Expectations:
- Built using Python
- Uses `python-telegram-bot` (or equivalent)
- Supports multiple users concurrently
- Fully hosted and running 24×7
- Easily extensible:
  - Add new predefined keywords
  - Add/update datasets
- Includes:
  - Proper configuration
  - Secure credential handling
  - Clean architecture
  - Maintainable codebase
